Spray-Blog
==========

Full disclosure: this blog built upon Spray REST API and Slick.

I used PlayFramework one year ago, first it's Java APIs, then I learned Scala, so I moved to Play's Scala API. Play is good, but slightly boring.

It's difficult because Play's system is tightly intertwined. So I choose to use Spray to build a REST-based blog.

It's smooth like a sail.
